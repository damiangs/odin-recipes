2. Add links to at least 3 recipe pages
3. Each recipe page should include:
   - An image of the finished dish
   - A description of the recipe
   - An unordered list of ingredients
   - An ordered list of steps to follow

## File Structure

```
odin-recipes/
│
├── index.html
│
└── recipes/
    ├── recipe1.html
    ├── recipe2.html
    └── recipe3.html
```

## Skills Demonstrated

- Basic HTML structure
- Working with headings, paragraphs, and lists

## How to View

- Validate your HTML using the W3C Markup Validation Service

Happy coding!
